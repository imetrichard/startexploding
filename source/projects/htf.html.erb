          <p>Hack the Future is a one-day party and hackathon for kids in grades 5-12. It’s a self-directed hackathon
            for future hackers. And, it’s a unique opportunity to learn modern software and hardware design and
            engineering from mentors in bay area startups and companies large and small. I handled the creation of
            branding around the event as well as digital and promotional assets as well as serve as a design mentor.
          </p>

          <h3>Bringing Fun Into the Brand</h3>

          <p>Our first step was to discover the methods in which architects and designers worked today. We conducted interviews with
            target user groups and discovered the methods in which they worked. What we discovered was that the communication
            happening between teams and also with their clients relied on very traditional approach; printed documents,
            long email chains combined with calls and face to face meetings. The process was slow, the approval process was delayed by
            physicality. We saw there was room for improvement but problems lied ahead of us. Ease of use, adoption, user
            invitation and roles.
