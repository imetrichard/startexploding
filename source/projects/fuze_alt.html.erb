        <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
          enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
          bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
          existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
          and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
