      <p>
        Daimler, the makers of Mercedes-Benz, gave our team a tight timeframe and a lofty goal - reimagine the car and
        driver experience.

        Our goal: combine a human-centered approach to software development and leverage the latest technology to
        develop Mercedes’ first-ever connected car experience. Design what the mobile/car transition looked like in a
        connected world. Build improvements as the car technology improved, such as AI powered predictive routing.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Daimler didn’t have software that took advantage of the progressively expanding car capabilities.
        Their questions, How might we better understand the car driver experience? How might we leverage the latest
        car and consumer technologies to improve it?
      </p>

      <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      <p>With the app, drivers could locate their car and remotely lock from anywhere. They could view diagnostics
        such as gas level and tire pressure and be alerted to issues. The app also integrated with the car's head
        unit, enhancing in-car navigation capabilities.
      </p>

      <h3>Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        The app launched at the revered International Motor Show and became available to German MB owners. We continued
        to design and develop improvements, now with usage data, while helping establish Daimler’s internal product team
        and practices.
