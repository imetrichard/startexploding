        <h3>User interface mockup for proposed user avatar creator</h3>

        <p>Client wanted to create an anonymous social network for sales people. Instead of profile photos they wanted
          to allow user created avatars which they could make part of the gamification of the service. Teamed with
          clients to discover their needs as well as researched the avatar creation landscape. Used
          information gathered and worked with devs to compile a guiding functional specification for the feature. Their
          needs, easy to pick up and use, frictionless, low density that still allows for a lot fo customization but most
          importantly something that users were excited to use. Their plans were to eventually roll into unlockables into
          the system earned by performing actions on the site.</p>

        <h3>Deeper levels customization contain both available and locked options to engage users</h3>

        <%= image_tag("portfolio/avatar4.png", :alt => "Fuze") %>

        <h3>Using some simple sliders and customization options the avatar begins to take life.</h3>

        <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
          enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
          bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
          existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
          and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
