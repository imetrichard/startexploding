        <h3><strong>The Green Room</strong></h3>

        <p>One of the biggest hurdles was the process of joining meetings via audio and video. Also is my audio working.
          How do I look. I took a page from the world of entertainment and the concept of a green room, a place where people
          get ready to appear on camera. THis enables users to connect with confidence.</p>

        <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
          enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
          bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
          existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
          and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
