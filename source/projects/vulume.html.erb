          <h1>Transforming How Architects, Contractors, and Designers collaborate.</h1>
          <p>
            Vulume's founder approached us with impassioned project from the world of architecture. He envisioned a digital tool to improve and streamline architectural projects. Think of it as Basecamp for architects and designers, where they can work collaboratively with contractors and clients on a projects ranging from decor to large-scale construction. We took on the project because we really believed we could make some
            positive impact and, after a kickoff, the project began.
          </p>

          <h3>The Heart of the Matter</h3>

          <p>
            Our first step was to discover the methods in which architects and designers work today. We conducted
            interviews with target user groups and discovered the methods in which they worked. We shadowed target users
            and followed them with field studies onsite to see how they communicated with contractors and clients. We
            observed, we asked, we absorbed. What we discovered was that the communication happening between teams and
            also with their clients relied on very traditional approach; printed documents, long email chains combined
            with calls, and face-to-face meetings. The process was slow; the approval process was delayed by physicality.
            We saw there was room for improvement, but problems lay ahead of us: ease of use, adoption, user invitation,
            and roles.
          </p>

          <h3>Everything in One Place</h3>

          <p>
            Because it was a collaboration app, it was necessary to create different roles, each with different views
            and functionality based on the role. This helped with the various aspects of collaboration and presentation
            within the system. In addition to varying roles, there were differences in project types for public vs
            private projects, with different goals for each.  We introduced an idea of open-sourcing some architectural
            projects while private projects would serve the more traditional role of project collaboration and
            presentation only for stakeholders. For all projects, be they open or private, we wanted to ensure that
            ease of use was there. We designed a top-level repository that caught the users uploads and was specific to
            their account; this let users easily attach files to other projects in the future (We found this very
            helpful, as most architects have different styles and materials that they use regularly and this allows
            them to attach them to projects to be reviewed and commented on by their clients.)
          </p>

          <h3>Bringing the Idea of Open Source and Discovery to the Architectural Community</h3>

          <p>
            Public projects allowed watchers to follow the projects creation and evolution and also to even contribute
            and comment, much like open source software projects. Using the idea of a public, open source project, we
            began to realize the system needed to introduce the concept of discovery. This “Discover” section afforded
            the users the luxury of getting inspiration for their own ideas, and even finding like-minded designers who
            they could communicate and collaborate with. We utilized smart tagging and tiered browsing, as well as
            providing users with the ability to search for specific info and labels. In addition to that, we wanted to
            make it easier to generate  inspiration through the capture CTA and the Chrome extension to capture anything
            across the web.
