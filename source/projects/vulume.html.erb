          <p>Vulume's founder approached us with impassioned project stemming from world of architecture. He envisioned a digital
            tool to improve and streamline architectural projects. Think of it as Basecamp for architects and designers where they can work
            collaboratively with contractors and clients on a projects ranging from decor to large-scale construction.
          </p>

          <h3>The Heart of the Matter</h3>

          <p>Our first step was to discover the methods in which architects and designers worked today. We conducted interviews with
            target user groups and discovered the methods in which they worked. What we discovered was that the communication
            happening between teams and also with their clients relied on very traditional approach; printed documents,
            long email chains combined with calls and face to face meetings. The process was slow, the approval process was delayed by
            physicality. We saw there was room for improvement but problems lied ahead of us. Ease of use, adoption, user
            invitation and roles.
