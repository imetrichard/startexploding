        <h1>Revamping The Fuze User Experience</h1>

        <p>Our team revamped Fuze, a platform specialized in the enabling future of work. With Fuze, employers empower
          their distributed workforce through telecommunications, project collaboration and more.

          The project was a massive undertaking spanning desktop, mobile, tablet, and responsive web.

          We began with understanding the workplaces and employees that currently used the product. We conducted remote
          and onsite research with clients like Evernote, AstraZeneca, and Ogilvy.  We wanted to understand how they
          worked, how they used the tool and any pain points. We also embedded ourselves into internal sales and success
          departments to get insights from the frontlines.</p>

        <%= image_tag("portfolio/sketch_1.jpg", :alt => "Fuze") %>

        <h3>Finding Problems and Working Toward Solutions</h3>

        <p>While we found many improvement opportunities, we devoted our attention to key experiences. About
          telecommunications we found a recurrent theme, â€œthe join process isn't intuitive".

          For hosts, we found significant time was spent troubleshooting and assisting new attendees. A customer survey
          confirmed this pain point and the solution design process began.

          After sketches, we then graduated to paper prototypes and hallway testing non-power users. After iterating
          internally we tested externally with new users with clickable prototypes. We iterated between every few tests
          and learned a lot.
        </p>

        <%= image_tag("portfolio/fuze_2.jpg", :alt => "Fuze") %>

        <p>We arrived at the "Green Room". Fuze's new join process that aimed to be intuitive, comfortable, and fast.
          Using smart defaults, we started users with the best settings for productive meetings. Adjusting settings
          from that default is simple. And if necessary, the user moving the meeting to a mobile device was seamless --
          great for on the go.</p>

        <p>
          The "Green Room" also tackled another pain point for our users -- video call discomfort. Using the Green Room
          they had an in-between state to do what we all want to do before appearing on camera; do I look ok? is my
          audio working? how do I sound?

          After launch, we found an increase in video-based meetings from 40% to 67%. In user meeting satisfaction also
          increased, stemming from an increase in face-to-face interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Streamlining Processes</h3>
        <p>
          Fuze itself was a distributed workforce with teams located across various time zones.  With this in mind, our
          design team worked to ensure the design held up across teams. We worked to improve dev/design communication --
          essential with so many platform teams. We adopted a workflow that was in line with how they worked -- working
          in their tools on their sprint schedules.

          Together, we created and iterated on a design wiki. The wiki communicated style, functionality, and intention
          to development team. Devs now could easy locate all information for a component; states, assets, style, etc.
        </p>


        <h3>Browser Experience</h3>

        <p>
          I also helped lead the charge on a rich web-based experience. Using cutting edge technology we allowed
          conferencing to happen in browser. This meant no wait times or heavyweight download: a key to get attendees
          in fast.
        </p>

        <%= image_tag("portfolio/fuze_3.jpg", :alt => "Fuze") %>

        <p>
          Shortly after the launch of the "new Fuze" the company was acquired a testament to the work of the entire team.
