        <h3>Rethinking the App from the Ground Up</h3>

        <p>I was brought on by the product team to help mold the future of Fuze, an HD audio and video meeting solution for
        business. Since a legacy app existed we examined what worked and what didn't we interviewed customers and departments
        to find what they liked, how they worked, how they included digital products in their workflow, and their pain points.</p>

        <h3>Starting From the Beginning</h3>

        <p>Right away we kept hearing similar feedback. The "join process isn't intuitive", "we're ending up having to
          troubleshoot and walkthrough people we invite who are using fuze for the first time". A customer survey confirmed
        this painpoint and the design thinking process began. We iterated fast -- sketching at first and looking at them
          cross teams, then graduating to paper prototypes and lofi testing with internal user. Once we had a path we
          felt might work we recruited users from our target user groups (based on created personas) and began watching
          them use digital prototypes. We learned a lot.</p>

        <p>What we ended up implementing was the Fuze Green Room. A place that was so easy it's didn't require coaching.
          It defaulted to the primary best settings for productive meetings - HD quality video on and VoIP on and projecting
          the audio. Adjusting the settings are simple as a tap of click and moving to phone for audio was a click away.
          What's more is it helped to tackle another pain point for our users -- the resistance to being on video. Using
          the green room they had an in between state to do what we all want to do before hopping onto camera; do I look
          ok, is my audio working, how do I sound?  It didn't end there, after implementation we examined how the piece
          fit in holistically with the rest of the app, we looked at how we would adapt what we learned onto not just
          desktop platforms but to touch devices as well and also what happens when we're implementing on platforms
          with much more restrictions on what could be done (as in the case of our browser client). </p>

        <h3>Browser Experience</h3>

        <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
          enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
          bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
          existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
          and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
