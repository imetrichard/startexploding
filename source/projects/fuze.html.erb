        <h3>Reworking the App from the Ground Up</h3>

        <p>I was brought on by the product team to help mold the future of Fuze, an HD audio and video meeting solution for
        businesses small and large. It was a massive undertaking with Windows, Mac, and Linux clients as well as native
        clients for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.
         We interviewed customers to find how they worked, how they included digital products in their workflow, and discovering their pain points.
        We also met with stakeholders and embedded ourselves in internal departments such as Sales and Customer Service to really
        gauge the pulse of the product and get insight into what they were hearing on the frontlines.</p>

        <%= image_tag("portfolio/fuze_2.jpg", :alt => "Fuze") %>

        <h3>Problem Solving. We're on the Case!</h3>

        <p>Right away we kept hearing similar feedback. The "join process isn't intuitive", "we're ending up having to
          troubleshoot and walkthrough people we invite who are using fuze for the first time". A customer survey confirmed
        this painpoint and the design thinking process began. We iterated fast -- sketching at first and looking at them
          cross teams, then graduating to paper prototypes and lofi testing with internal user. Once we had a path we
          felt might work we recruited users from our target user groups (based on created personas) and began watching
          them use digital prototypes. We learned a lot.</p>

        <%= image_tag("portfolio/fuze_4.png", :alt => "Fuze") %>

        <p>What we ended up implementing was the Fuze Green Room. A place that was so easy it's didn't require coaching.
          It defaulted to the primary best settings for productive meetings - HD quality video on and VoIP on and projecting
          the audio. Adjusting the settings are simple as a tap of click and moving to phone for audio was a click away.
          What's more is it helped to tackle another pain point for our users -- the resistance to being on video. Using
          the green room they had an in between state to do what we all want to do before hopping onto camera; do I look
          ok, is my audio working, how do I sound?  It didn't end there, after implementation we examined how the piece
          fit in holistically with the rest of the app, we looked at how we would adapt what we learned onto not just
          desktop platforms but to touch devices as well and also what happens when we're implementing on platforms
          with much more restrictions on what could be done (as in the case of our browser client). </p>

        <h3>Streamlining Process</h3>
        <p>
          Being a complex and rich application being developed by many teams located across the world lead to another major hurdle.
          How do we ensure the design is implemented correctly and how do we communicate our designs functionality and look and feel
          to developers. After a few design brainstorms and worky closing with devs and a lot of trial and error we created the internal Fuze design wiki.
          Using it developer could locate the full functionality of a feature, including viewing deltas between iterations
          and see completely, every state, every icon name, and callouts on how they could recreate correctly in code.
          We also made ourselves completely available to devs, have a question at anytime and we're there to respond.
          Unsure what a feature involved. Let's get the team together and do a quick walkthrough and Q&A session. Does the
          design not work from a dev perspective? Let's get together and find out how we can accomplish our goals given
          new dev restrictions. It was hugely collaborative time in the company and continues to be the way we do things
          long after the apps were shipped.
        </p>


        <h3>Browser Experience</h3>

        <p>Not longer after the native clients launch I helped lead the charge on a rich HTML5 experience using the power
          of webRTC--a technology that allows for audio and video meeting to happen from the comfort of the user's browser.
          This presented even more challenges such as limitation of what we could do in the web app and how to optimize
          for a web experience while at the same time working to keep consistent with the look, feel and interaction model
          of the desktop native apps. Another challenge was the dev team charged with implementing the browser experience
        was thousands of miles away in Bulgaria, which in itself posed a large challenge. Early mornings, late nights,
          quick turnaround, and thought through experience (as well as a two week heads down work session in Sofia) led
          to the fuze HTML Browser client. A fast an easy way for attendees to join a meeting without having to
          download or install a separate application. </p>
