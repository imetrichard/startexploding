      <p>I'm specialised in Product Design, UI Design, UX Design, and Interaction with a firm foot in Visual Design.
        As a designer with a knowledge of front-end web development, I know first-hand the power of the platform and
        there is nothing I find more fulfilling as taking a mockup and pixel-perfectly creating it in code.</p>

      <p>My passions are slick interfaces, frictionless user interaction, and adventure. I revel in the process and work to
        deliver top-notch, highly-accessible designs that both look great and are easy to use.</p>

      <p>In my spare time, you can find me at a show (I'm a huge music fan), chaperoning my dog
        <a href="http://instagram.com/ohiathedog" target="_blank"> (she's a party animal)</a>, or working on something
        (itâ€™s fun making things).</p>

      <strong>Nice to meet you.</strong>
